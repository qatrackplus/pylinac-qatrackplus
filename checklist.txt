Version Release Checklist

- Run tests: tests/_test_all.py
- See if anything needs amending in the GUI or in the watcher since those are hard to test.
- Increment version number in:
    - setup.py,
    - pylinac/__init__.py
    - docs/source/conf.py
    - conda/pylinac/meta.yaml
- List changes in docs/source/changelog.rst
- If a new module:
    - Add snippet to README.rst
- Build: run setup.py task..., `bdist_wheel` to make a wheel
- Upload to PyPI: `twine upload dist/pylinac-...*` where ... is the version; e.g. `1.4.0`
  to upload both the .zip and .whl files.
- Create conda distributions:
    This assumes you're in the root pylinac folder and have uploaded the newest version to PyPI:
    - Update conda/pylinac/meta.yaml file to newest PyPI version
    - Run `conda build conda/pylinac --python 3.3 --python 3.4 --python 3.5`.
      This builds and upload the conda packages; file output location: D:\Python\Miniconda3\conda-bld\win-32
    - Move build to pylinac's `conda/win-32` folder
    - 'cd' to conda folder
    - Convert all the builds for all OS platforms w/ `conda convert --platform all -f conda/win-32/pylinac...`
    - Explicitly upload other platforms with `anaconda upload conda/xxxx/pylinac-m.m.b*` where xxxx is the platform (linux-32, etc)
      and 1.* is the newest version bump (so only uploads those files, not old ones, e.g. /pylinac-1.5.6*)
